# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create network resolution utility function


  - Create a utility function to resolve user network with correct priority (rede > empresa > sub_rede)
  - Add comprehensive logging for network resolution decisions
  - Include type definitions and JSDoc documentation
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_




- [ ] 2. Update promotion service network logic
  - [ ] 2.1 Fix getPromotions method to use correct network field
    - Replace current network resolution logic with new utility function
    - Update filtering logic to use resolved network consistently


    - Add logging to track which network value is being used for filtering
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_



  - [ ] 2.2 Fix createPromotion method to use correct network mapping
    - Update Rede field to use resolved network (not sub_rede priority)
    - Ensure Sub_Rede field is populated separately with actual sub_rede value
    - Update payload construction to use correct field mapping



    - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.2, 3.1_

- [x] 3. Update store loading logic for consistency


  - Modify loadStores function in promotions page to use same network resolution
  - Ensure Super Admin and regular user logic uses consistent network determination
  - Add validation to verify network consistency between store loading and promotion creation
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.3_



- [ ] 4. Add network resolution validation
  - Create validation function to check if resolved network exists in shot_lojas table
  - Add error handling for cases where user has no valid network


  - Implement fallback behavior when network resolution fails
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.3_

- [x] 5. Create unit tests for network resolution



  - Write tests for network resolution utility function with various user data scenarios
  - Test priority order: rede > empresa > sub_rede
  - Test edge cases with null/undefined values
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 6. Create integration tests for promotion service
  - Write tests for getPromotions method with corrected network logic
  - Write tests for createPromotion method with proper field mapping
  - Test consistency between filtering and creation operations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 7. Update promotion page component logic
  - Ensure loadUserData function provides all necessary network fields
  - Update error handling to account for network resolution failures
  - Add user feedback for network-related issues
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 8. Verify data consistency across the system
  - Test end-to-end flow: load stores → create promotion → verify correct network usage
  - Validate that existing promotions are not affected by the changes
  - Ensure backward compatibility with existing data
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_
