# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze current syntax error context
  - Read the exact lines around the error (1375-1385)
  - Identify the specific function or block causing the issue
  - Check for unclosed brackets, parentheses, or braces
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1_

- [x] 2. Examine useEffect and function structures
  - Review the `carregarCashback` function structure
  - Check if all useEffect hooks are properly closed
  - Verify async function declarations and closures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 3. Fix identified syntax issues




  - Correct any unclosed blocks or functions in `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - Remove problematic empty lines that may cause parsing issues
  - Ensure proper JavaScript/TypeScript syntax structure
  - Add missing closing brackets, parentheses, or braces as needed
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.2_

- [ ] 4. Implement syntax validation tests
  - Create a simple test to verify the file compiles without errors
  - Write unit tests to check component structure integrity
  - Implement automated syntax checking for future changes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 3.3_

- [ ] 5. Validate compilation and core functionality
  - Test that the file compiles without syntax errors using TypeScript compiler
  - Verify that the dashboard component renders without runtime errors
  - Confirm that all React hooks and state management work correctly
  - Test that async functions execute without throwing errors
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 6. Test dashboard data loading functionality
  - Verify that cashback data loads correctly from the database
  - Test birthday report data retrieval and processing
  - Confirm that all statistical data is fetched and displayed
  - Validate error handling for failed data requests
  - _Requirements: 2.3_

- [ ] 7. Test interactive chart components
  - Verify all charts render correctly (birthday, cashback, promotions)
  - Test tooltip functionality and hover effects on all charts
  - Confirm legend interactions and filtering work properly
  - Test chart responsiveness and layout adjustments
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 8. Test navigation and pop-up functionality
  - Confirm pop-up navigation and interactions work correctly
  - Test modal dialogs and their close/open functionality
  - Verify that all clickable elements respond appropriately
  - Test keyboard navigation and accessibility features
  - _Requirements: 2.2_

- [ ] 9. Perform comprehensive regression testing
  - Test birthday chart with tooltip and legend interactions
  - Verify Cash Back chart with filtered legend functionality
  - Confirm promotion charts with expanded layout work
  - Test all existing dashboard features for any regressions
  - Validate that no previously working functionality was broken
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_
