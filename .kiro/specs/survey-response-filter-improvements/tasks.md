# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix dropdown layout and styling issues


  - Update SurveyResponseDropdown component to use fixed height and dynamic width
  - Implement horizontal expansion for long text selections
  - Add text truncation with ellipsis for very long options
  - Test layout consistency across different text lengths
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6_



- [ ] 2. Implement response filter logic in API
  - Update survey API route to accept and process responseFilter parameter
  - Add SQL WHERE clause logic for filtering by response values (1-4)
  - Implement proper parameter validation and sanitization
  - Add error handling for invalid filter values


  - Test API with different filter combinations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 4.3_

- [ ] 3. Update survey preview modal with filter functionality
  - Modify SurveyPreviewModal to display filtered data
  - Add visual indicator when filter is active


  - Implement "no data found" message for empty filter results
  - Add filtered count display (e.g., "Showing 15 of 100 records")
  - Test modal behavior with different filter states
  - _Requirements: 1.6, 1.7, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_

- [x] 4. Integrate filter with configuration system


  - Update FilterConfiguration interface to include responseFilter field
  - Modify save/load configuration functions to handle response filter
  - Ensure filter persistence works correctly with existing configurations
  - Add migration logic for existing configurations without responseFilter
  - Test configuration save/load with response filters
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_



- [ ] 5. Add visual feedback and validation
  - Implement active filter indicator in dropdown component
  - Add validation to prevent report generation with no filtered data
  - Create user-friendly error messages for filter-related issues
  - Add loading states during filter application


  - Test user feedback across different scenarios
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 6. Update export functionality to respect filters
  - Modify Excel export service to apply response filter
  - Update PDF generation to include filtered data only



  - Ensure export file names reflect applied filters
  - Add filter information to exported report headers
  - Test exports with various filter combinations
  - _Requirements: 1.6_

- [ ] 7. Create comprehensive tests for filter functionality
  - Write unit tests for dropdown component layout fixes
  - Create API integration tests for response filtering
  - Add end-to-end tests for complete filter workflow
  - Implement visual regression tests for layout consistency
  - Test error scenarios and edge cases
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_

- [ ] 8. Performance optimization and cleanup
  - Add database index on resposta column if not exists
  - Implement query optimization for filtered results
  - Add debouncing to filter changes to reduce API calls
  - Clean up any unused code or deprecated filter logic
  - Test performance with large datasets and various filters
  - _Requirements: Performance and scalability considerations_
