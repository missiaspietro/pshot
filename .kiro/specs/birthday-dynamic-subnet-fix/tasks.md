# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Search and identify all hardcoded "bababibi" references


  - Use grep search to find all occurrences of "bababibi" in the codebase
  - Document each location and its context
  - Verify which files need modification
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_



- [ ] 2. Create utility function for subnet display logic
  - Implement `getDisplaySubnet` function with proper fallback logic
  - Add TypeScript types for user data and display states
  - Include error handling and null checks


  - Write unit tests for the utility function
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.1_

- [ ] 3. Update birthday page component to use dynamic subnet
  - Replace hardcoded "bababibi" with dynamic user subnet in `app/birthdays/page.tsx`


  - Implement loading state while user data is being fetched
  - Add error handling for cases where user data cannot be loaded
  - Ensure fallback to empresa when sub_rede is not available
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 3.2_



- [ ] 4. Add proper loading and error states to subnet display
  - Implement skeleton/spinner for loading state
  - Add error message display for authentication failures
  - Handle case when user is not logged in
  - Ensure smooth transitions between states
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.3_




- [ ] 5. Test the dynamic subnet functionality
  - Test with user having sub_rede defined
  - Test with user having only empresa (fallback scenario)
  - Test with user not logged in
  - Test error scenarios (network failures, invalid data)
  - Verify consistency between displayed subnet and filtered messages
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 6. Clean up any remaining hardcoded references
  - Remove any backup files or commented code with "bababibi"
  - Ensure no other components reference the hardcoded value
  - Update any documentation that might reference the old implementation
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_
